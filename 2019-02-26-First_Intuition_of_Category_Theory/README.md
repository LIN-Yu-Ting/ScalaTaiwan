# First Intuition of Category Theory
In Scala programming, we do andThen, map, or flapMap many times but without thinking about what they are originally. Maybe you have tried to study materials which talk about Composition, Functor, and Monad. Either understanding or ignoring, it seems does not bother your daily code job. Actually, it does matter something deeply. 

In this talk, I will show you a straightforward perspective of relation between functional programming and Category theory. Grasping category theory ideas intuitively rather than obscure thought and hard to link to programming.
