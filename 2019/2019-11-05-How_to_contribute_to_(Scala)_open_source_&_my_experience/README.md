# How to contribute to (Scala) open source & my experience

I will talk about how I made 13x pull requests to open source. 
And it will be a talk about the soft part of contributing to (Scala) open source. 
If you don't know anything about Scala, it will be fine since my slides won't contain any (Scala or Java) source code. 
In the end, I hope you can know the way I contribute to open source. 
Then you can contribute to open source too.

[Here](how_to_contribute_open_source.pdf) is the slides.
